Title: Quantifying permeability of barriers for animal movement
Version: 1.0.0.0
Authors: Anonymous
Description: This package estimates the permeability of a linear barrier for a set of tracking data, with the option to estimate permeability as a function of covariate(s). Package includes functions to format data, create a "crossing table" of null and actual animal crossings of a barrier, plot crossings, and fit permeability null and covariate models for model comparison and estimation of permeability.
